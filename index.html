                <p>We are Skill Issue. We began playing music in April 2025, and we are from a small town called Fort Thomas in northern Kentucky. We have 3 members: Hunter Cole, Emmett Young and Eli Daly. For now, we are just a small cover band, but we will upgrade to our own unique music, and eventually start playing live.  You can support us by watching our content on Youtube and buying our merch!</p>
